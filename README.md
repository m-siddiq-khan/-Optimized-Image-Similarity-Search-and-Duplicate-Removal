# Optimized Image Similarity Search and Duplicate Removal

# Overview  
This project is an efficient and scalable solution for finding similar images and detecting duplicates within large datasets using Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and Bloom Filter techniques. The project is designed to handle large-scale image data, leveraging the power of PySpark for distributed data processing. The focus is on celebrity image datasets, with algorithms optimized for high performance and scalability.
